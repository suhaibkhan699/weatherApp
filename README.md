# WeatherApp
• Weather Application that fetches data using a third‑party API key.<br />
• Implemented an API Proxy Server with Node.js to avoid passing the key directly from the front end and to fetch data from VisualCrossingWeather API.<br />
• Implemented Rate Limiting and Caching mechanisms to improve performance by limiting the number of requests users can make within a fixed time and storing responses for a set duration.
